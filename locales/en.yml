  introduction: "Hacarus Visual Inspection Api"
  introductionMessage: "Hacarus is a provider of lightweight and explainable AI solutions for manufacturing and medical industries.
  <br/><br/>
  Our technology is based on Sparse Modeling, a Machine Learning technique that understands data like a human would - by its unique key features. Sparse Modeling is especially useful in resource constraint environments where computing power, cloud connection and availability of training data are limited – thanks to its lightweight design.
  <br/><br/>
  Our solutions can run in an offline environment on embedded systems or as a cloud module. Compared with conventional DL based approaches we are far more resource efficient and produce better results.
  <br/><br/>

  termsMessage: "A brief explanation of the terms used throughout this documentation:
<br/><br/>
<b>Model</b><br/>
A model is created (or trained) by applying an algorithm to a data-set of items (also called training-data), along with the configuration of a set of parameters.
After creation, the model can be used to analyze new data.
<br/><br/>
<b>Algorithm</b><br/>
The machine learning code that is used to build a model – selected depending on the nature of the visual inspection task and the expected precision and performance.
<br/><br/>
<b>Training</b><br/>
The process of creating a new model.
<br/><br/>
<b>Parameter</b><br/>
Parameters are used to configure how an algorithm should be applied during the training. For example the minimal or maximum accepted image resolution, etc.
<br/><br/>
<b>Item</b><br/>
An item represents the data of a single product that is the subject of the inspection. One item can have one or several images associated.
For example: A packaging box in a storage warehouse, with 6 images for each of the 6 box sides.

To get started, you need the following:
<ul>
  <li>
    Client ID and Client Secret
    <ul>
      <li>
        These will be used to authorize the SDK.
      </li>
      <li>
        An authorized user will be able to access the system's functions, such as adding items, getting list of items, algorithms, and models.
      </li>
      <li>
        To be able to train models and to use the predict function, you also need an active license.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    License File
    <ul>
      <li>
        These will be used to activate your license.

  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    Training Images
    <ul>
      <li>
        A prerequisite to creating a new model, is to provide training items by uploading images.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use training items to create a model.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add items for prediction by uploading images.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use the created model to predict the items for prediction.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sample images for evaluation are available for download here: <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zg*gCX9gxxYjEau9j29oe0hDBuppDosh/view'>Metal Plates</a> and <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oRvEfeDfa3seEn0rFXRa1IgTUyzg0hxv/view'>Wood Blocks</a>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Contains good and defect images and a list of parameters you may use to create a model.
          </li>
          <li>
            Images for training are located in a folder `train`, images for prediction are in `predict`
          </li>
          <li>
            NG means defect image, OK means good images
